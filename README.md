If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think the next improvement
that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural
design.

- I think i would prioritize next would be improving the salary deduction formula especially if the employee has more than 1 absences because as of the moment based on the exam is that even if i had 1 or more than 1 absences the deduction formula would also be the same, another is the tax rate computation as it is a static value i think there is an existing income tax table depending on the basic salary rate of an employee. Another is also the computation for a Contractual employee, even if the employee is a contractual it is also mandatory to have a tax deduction according also to his basic salary being received.
